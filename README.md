# Predicting Heart Disease using Machine Learning ðŸ«€
This notebook looks into using various Python-based machine learning and data science libraries in an attempt to build a machine learning model capable of predicting whether or not someone has heart disease based on their medical attributes.

We're going to take the following approach:

1) Problem definition
2) Data
3) Evaluation
4) Features
5) Modelling
6) Experimentation

### 1. Problem Definition

In a statement,

Given clinical parameters about a patient, can we predict whether or not they have heart disease?

### 2. Data
   
The original data came from the Cleavland data from the UCI Machine Learning Repository. https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/heart+Disease

There is also a version of it available on Kaggle. https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/sumaiyatasmeem/heart-disease-classification-dataset

### 3. Evaluation

If we can reach 95% accuracy at predicting whether or not a patient has heart disease during the proof of concept, we'll pursue the project.

### 4. Features

This is where you'll get different information about each of the features in your data. You can do this via doing your own research (such as looking at the links above) or by talking to a subject matter expert (someone who knows about the dataset).

Create data dictionary:

**1) age** - age in years

**2) sex** - (1 = male; 0 = female)

**3) cp** - chest pain type

    0: Typical angina: chest pain related decrease blood supply to the heart
    
    1: Atypical angina: chest pain not related to heart
    
    2: Non-anginal pain: typically esophageal spasms (non heart related)
    
    3: Asymptomatic: chest pain not showing signs of disease
    
**4) trestbps** - resting blood pressure (in mm Hg on admission to the hospital) anything above 130-140 is typically cause for concern

**5) chol** - serum cholestoral in mg/dl

    serum = LDL + HDL + .2 * triglycerides
  
  above 200 is cause for concern
  
**6) fbs** - (fasting blood sugar > 120 mg/dl) (1 = true; 0 = false)

    '>126' mg/dL signals diabetes
  
**7) restecg** - resting electrocardiographic results

    0: Nothing to note
  
    1: ST-T Wave abnormality can range from mild symptoms to severe problems signals non-normal heart beat
     
    2: Possible or definite left ventricular hypertrophy Enlarged heart's main pumping chamber
     
**8) thalach** - maximum heart rate achieved

**9) exang** - exercise induced angina (1 = yes; 0 = no)

**10) oldpeak** - ST depression induced by exercise relative to rest looks at stress of heart during excercise unhealthy heart will stress more

**11) slope** - the slope of the peak exercise ST segment

     0: Upsloping: better heart rate with excercise (uncommon)
   
     1: Flatsloping: minimal change (typical healthy heart)
   
     2: Downslopins: signs of unhealthy heart
   
**12) ca** - number of major vessels (0-3) colored by flourosopy colored vessel means the doctor can see the blood passing through the more blood movement the better (no clots)

**13) thal** - thalium stress result

     1,3: normal
   
     6: fixed defect: used to be defect but ok now
   
     7: reversable defect: no proper blood movement when excercising
   
**14) target** - have disease or not (1=yes, 0=no) (= the predicted attribute)

### 5. Modelling

Now we've got our data split into training and test sets, it's time to build a machine learning model.

We'll train it (find the patterns) on the training set.

And we'll test it (use the patterns) on the test set.

We're going to try 3 different machine learning models:

1. Logistic Regression
2. K-Nearest Neighbours Classifier
3. Random Forest Classifier

### 6. Experimentation
If you haven't hit your evaluation metric yet... ask yourself...

- Could you collect more data?

- Could you try a better model? Like CatBoost or XGBoost?

- Could you improve the current models? (beyond what we've done so far)

- If your model is good enough (you have hit your evaluation metric) how would you export it and share it with others?
